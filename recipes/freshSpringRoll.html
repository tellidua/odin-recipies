    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook vermicelli noodles in boiling water, for just a few minutes, 
            according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gather all topping ingredients together, including 
            chopped veggies, herbs, cooked shrimp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add about 1 inch of water to a large, deep dish, or pie pan. 
            Place one rice wrapper into the water and let soak for just 
            10-15 seconds. It should still feel pretty firm as you remove 
            it and lay it on your counter or plate. 
        </li>
        <li>
            (It will soften up as you add the filling ingredients, but 
            If you let it soak for too long it will get too soft and will 
            tear when you roll it up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer 1-2 slices of each veggie, a few shrimp, a few leaves of 
            each herb and a pinch of noodles on the â…“ of the spring roll 
            that is closest to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the sides of the spring roll in over the ingredients. Then 
            pull the side closest to you up and over the ingredients, sealing 
            everything together tightly, and rolling it up like a burrito.
        </li>
    </ol>
